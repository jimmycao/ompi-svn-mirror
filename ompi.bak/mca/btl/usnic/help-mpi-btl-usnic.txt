[ibv API failed]
Open MPI failed a basic verbs operation on a Cisco usNIC device.  This
is highly unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be
something wrong with the usNIC or OpenFabrics configuration on this
server.

In addition to any suggestions listed below, you might want to check
the Linux "memlock" limits on your system (they should probably be
"unlimited").  See this FAQ entry for details:

    http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-locked-pages

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Server:          %s
  Device:          %s
  Port:            %d
  Failed function: %s (%s:%d)
  Description:     %s
#
[not enough usnic resources]
There are not enough usNIC resources on a VIC for all the MPI
processes on this server.

This means that you have either not provisioned enough usNICs on this
VIC, or there are not enough total receive, transmit, or completion
queues on the provisioned usNICs.  On each VIC in a given server, you
need to provision at least as many usNICs as MPI processes on that
server.  In each usNIC, you need to provision at least two each of the
following: send queues, receive queues, and completion queues.

Open MPI will skip this device in the usnic BTL, which may result in
either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Server:          %s
  Device:          %s
  Description:     %s
#
[create ibv resource failed]
Open MPI failed to allocate a usNIC-related resource on a VIC.  This
usually means one of two things:

1. You are running something other than this MPI job on this server
   that is consuming usNIC resources.
2. You have run out of locked Linux memory.  You should probably set
   the Linux "memlock" limits to "unlimited".  See this FAQ entry for
   details:

     http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ib-locked-pages

This Open MPI job will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which
may result in either lower performance or the job aborting.

#
[async event]
Open MPI detected a fatal error on a usNIC port.  Your MPI job will
now abort; sorry.

  Device:           %s
  Port:             %d

#
[internal error during init]
An internal error has occurred in the Open MPI usNIC BTL.  This is
highly unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be
something wrong with the usNIC or OpenFabrics configuration on this
server.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Server:          %s
  Device:          %s
  Port:            %d

  Description:     %s
#
[internal error after init]
An internal error has occurred in the Open MPI usNIC BTL.  This is
highly unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be
something wrong with the usNIC or OpenFabrics configuration on this
server.

  Server:       %s

#
[ibv API failed after init]
Open MPI failed a basic verbs operation on a Cisco usNIC device.  This
is highly unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be
something wrong with the usNIC or OpenFabrics configuration on this
server.

Your MPI job may behave erratically, hang, and/or abort.

  Description:     %s
#
[verbs_port_bw failed]
Open MPI failed to query the supported bandwidth of a port on a Cisco
usNIC device.  This is unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that
there may be something wrong with the usNIC or OpenFabrics
configuration on this server.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Server:     %s
  Device:     %s
  Port:       %d
#
[eager_limit too high]
The eager_limit in the usnic BTL is too high for a device that Open
MPI tried to use.  The usnic BTL eager_limit value is the largest
message payload that Open MPI will send in a single datagram.  

You are seeing this message because the eager_limit was set to a value
larger than the MPI message payload capacity of a single UD datagram.
The max payload size is smaller than the size of individual datagrams
because each datagram also contains MPI control metadata, meaning that
the some bytes in the datagram must be reserved for overhead.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Server:                %s
  Device:                %s
  Port:                  %d
  Max payload allowed:   %d
  Specified eager_limit: %d
#
[check_reg_mem_basics fail]
The usNIC BTL failed to initialize while trying to register some
memory.  This typically can indicate that the "memlock" limits are set
too low.  For most HPC installations, the memlock limits should be set
to "unlimited".  The failure occurred here:

  Local host:    %s
  Memlock limit: %s

You may need to consult with your system administrator to get this
problem fixed.  This FAQ entry on the Open MPI web site may also be
helpful:

[MTU mismatch]
The MTU does not match on local and remote hosts.  All interfaces on all
hosts participating in an MPI job must be configured with the same MTU.
The device and port listed below will not be used to communicate with this
remote host.

  Local host:  %s
  Device/port: %s/%d
  Local MTU:   %d
  Remote host: %s
  Remote MTU:  %d
